# Welcome to BartVenture

## Background and Overview
   This is a Bart App targeted at tourists visiting the San Francisco Bay Area. A user can use the app to figure out where they can get to by Bart with a certain amount of money. In addition, users can look at the popular attractions near that Bart Station to better help them make up their mind where to explore.

## Functionality and MVP
* Map that shows users how far they can get with their budget on Bart.
* Markers within the map that shows public attractions, such as parks, museums, and stores
* Users can get more specific information of a certain public attraction,such as background and images by clicking the corresponding marker within the map
* User authentication

### Bonus
* Display weather within the map
* Display free events within the map

## Technologies and Technical Challenges

### This application will be built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), AWS, and socket.io:

* Backend: MongoDB/Express
    * User authentication to log users in for contributing to the live chat
    * Model for indexing of live chat feed
* Frontend: React/Redux
    * React/Redux will be used to change the route information when users type in a different budget.

## Things Accomplished Over the Weekend

Over the weekend, out team spent most of the time learning the new technologies we are going to implement. Here is a list of all the activities we took during the weekend:

* Watching tutorials and going over some readings on MERN Stack
* Researched API and figured out the available data we will have
* Discussing the whole project in details
* Finishing the User Auth
* Complete the project proposal

## Group Members and Work Breakdown: Urosh, Jing, Lawrence, Peter

* Phase 1 : Learn Technologies (Sat-Sun)
